            <h2>Project Overview & Requirements</h2>
            <p>Your final project will be in teams of 4-5 (according to how big your section is). 
                In your final project we ask you to think about creating a product that is interactive (think about things that are traditionally static, 
                and how can me turn them into dynamic artifacts that have a purpose or functionality). Below are your final project requirements:

         </p>
            <br> 
            
            <h5>Fabrication</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technique Requirement:</strong> Use at least one computer-aided fabrication method to create the prototype (ie, lasercutting, 3D printing etc).</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Interaction</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic System:</strong> Incorporate at least one form of dynamic and programmable change in the system, such as mechanical, visual, electrical, or tactile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Electronics</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arduino & Components:</strong> Must include an Arduino and other electronic components (like sensors) to enable interaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Polished Finish</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Professional Appearance:</strong> Ensure the prototype has a refined look with no exposed wires, burnt edges, or sharp corners (unless they serve a design purpose). The prototype must be fully assembled and ready for presentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Deliverable</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Live Demo Video:</strong> Submit a live demonstration with a video that showcases the prototype in action with an explanation of its features (we will also showcase this on demo day).</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Demo Day Setup & Options (Must be Present!)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Demonstration Options:</strong> Consider the following three ways to showcase your prototype:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guest Interaction (Best):</strong> Allow guests to interact directly with the prototype.</li>
                <li><strong>Presenter Interaction (Good):</strong> You demonstrate the systemâ€™s functionality while guests observe.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Interactive Display (Acceptable):</strong> Provide samples, a video, and a process overview without direct interaction.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
    
        <li><strong>Display Requirements:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Set up a screen (laptop or monitor) for video playback.</li>
        <li>Place a poster behind the demo area.</li>
        <li>Arrange a table to present the prototype, aligned with the selected demonstration approach.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
    </ul>
