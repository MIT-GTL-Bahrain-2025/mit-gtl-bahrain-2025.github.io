                    <p> This is the second in a series of two labs that will introduce you to building and programming your own robot.
                        In this lab, we‚Äôll extend the functionality of your robot by adding sensors, allowing it to interact with its environment.
                        You‚Äôll start by integrating photoresistors to guide your robot toward the brightest light. Then, you‚Äôll choose another sensor
                        to give your robot additional behaviors, such as obstacle avoidance or wall following. By the end of the lab, your robot will
                        sense and adapt to its surroundings autonomously.

                    <h4>Part (0): Reading Values from Photoresistors (25 mins)</h4>
        <p>Its time we used our Ardiuno to sense the outside world. There are hundreds of different types of sensors we could
            use, but we are going to start with the most simple. The good thing is that all sensors are easy to implement with
            Ardiuno.
        </p>

        <p>Our first sensor is a photoresistor. A photoresistor is a special type of resistor whose resistance depends on the 
            amount of light that shines on it. Higher luminosity decreases the resistance. They are simple, inexpensive, and 
            effective for detecting relative brightness, making them ideal for applications like guiding a robot toward a light source
        </p>

        <strong>Always have your arduino unpowered when breadboarding</strong>

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Download Motor Library </strong> Click the books icon on the left side of the Ardiuno IDE and install "Adafruit Motor Shield library"</li>
        <li>Initialize the libary. This tells Ardiuno that you can use functions from this external library</li>
        <li>Create motor objects for two motors</p>
        <li>Set motor speed. setSpeed only takes a range of 0-255. It sends a PWM signal to the motor.</li>
        <li>Set motor direction. The options are FORWARD, BACKWARD, and RELEASE</li>
        <li>Plug the motor sheild into the Ardiuno, making sure the pins are all aligned.</p>
        <li>Get two of the yellow TT motors and plug them into the M1 and M2 terminals on the shield as shown. It actually doesn't matter
            which terminal has red or black. If you swap it, it will just reverse the direction of the motor</li>
        <li>
            Upload the code. Why do the motors spin so slow? Its because they are being powered by the Ardiuno which
            cannot supply enough current. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Alter the code to switch the direction of the motors. Make sure it behaves how you expect it to</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        
        <p>Now, explicitly having to set motor direction every time we want to reverse is inefficient. Lets make
            a more convient function that can command our motors from a range of -255 to 255.
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li> Create a function at the bottom of your script like the following. We are going to be making a lot of functions, and 
                you will likely find it useful to use this as a template.
            </li>
            <li> We can call our function in the same we call any other function. The following code will swap the motor direction
                every 3 seconds using our handy new function. Make sure it behaves how you expect.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Part (2) Assembling the Chassis</h4>

        <p> We are now going to assemble our chassis. Make sure you have all the following pieces.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Laser cut chassis (<strong>x1</strong>)</li>
            <li>Motor mount (<strong>x2</strong>)</li>
            <li>Ardiuno + motor shield (<strong>x1</strong>)</li>
            <li>Ardiuno mount (<strong>x1</strong>)</li>
            <li>Caster wheel standoff (<strong>x2</strong>)  </li>
            <li>2/2.5/3mm screws.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Now attach compoents to the laser cut chassis in the following order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Attach the mounter mounts to the chassis using <strong>3mm x 12mm (x4)</strong> bolts</li>
            <li>Attach the Ardiuno to its mount and the chassis using <strong>3mm x 16mm (x3)</strong> bolts</li>
            <li>Attach the ball caster (?????????) and spacer spacer to its mount and the chassis using <strong>3mm x 16mm (x3)</strong> bolts</li>
            <li>Mount Motors to motor brackets using long <strong>3mm x 16mm (x3)</strong> bolts </li>
            <li>Mount Servo at front using <strong>2mm x 6mm (x3)</strong> bolts. This is a bit tricky so don't do it if you are running low on time. </li>
            <li>Use double sided tape to mount battery pack on bottom in orientation depicted</li>
            <li>Stick mini breadboard to robot</li>
            <li>Add wheel</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><b>Congrats!</b> You have built a robot. </p>

            <h4>Checkoff 2</h4> <a id="part2"> </a>
            Ask your instructor for a check-off on completing Part (2)

        <h4>Part (3) Driving the Robot</h4>

        <p> We are now going to control our robot</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Try driving your robot in a straight line by setting each motor to some speed.
                What do you notice about the direction? Does it drive straight?</li>
            <li> Adjust the relative motor speeds until your robot drives roughly straight.</li>
            <li>Create a new function at the end that drives straight a certain time called driveStraight(millis).
                 Fill in the values you found in the previous step.</li>
            <li>Test it by driving forward for .5,1,3 seconds</li>
            <li> Try to command your robot to turn in place exactly 90 degrees counter clockwise. How should
                each motor be commanded? Set a turn speed, and just alter the duration of turn to dial in 90 degrees.
                Call your function turnRight()
            </li>
            <li> Create a function with your robot now turning to the left. Call this function ‚ÄúturnLeft()‚Äù
            </li>
            In the loop() of your code, write code to drive in a square with side length 50cm clockwise.
            Do it again going counterclockwise. How well does it return to its starting location?
            What might cause this? What ideas of sensors could we use to fix this?
        </ol>

        <p> You may have noticed that it was difficult to get your robot to drive straight and turn a desired amount consistently.
            This is because the robot is open-loop. It has no idea where it is or where it is going. We are going to
            close the loop next lab by adding sensors so the robot can detect where it is and where it wants to go.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" style="background-color: #C94747; color: white;">
            <h4>Checkoff 3</h4> <a id="part2"> </a>
            Ask your instructor for a check-off on completing Part (3) CCW/CW loops.

    <!-- Part 1: Designing the Calendar -->
    <h4>Part (4) Remix Driving!</h4>

    <p> Now that you have a robot that can drive as you command it,
        try driving in more interesting shapes. Here are some ideas to get you started:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Drive in a circle with a desired radius</li>
        <li> Drive in an n-sided polygon (square, hexagon, octagon etc). Can you make a
             function that can take in a number of sides and drives in that shape?
        </li>
        <li> Drive in an infinity symbol </li>
        <li>Drive in the shape of some mathematical function</li>
    
    </ul>
