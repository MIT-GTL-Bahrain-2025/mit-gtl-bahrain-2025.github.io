        <li>Download <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software"> Arduino (5 mins)</a></li>
        <li>Plug in the Arduino Uno to your laptop</li>
        <li>Open Arduino</li>
        <li>Let's try coding. Line that begin with a <b>//</b> are comments which are instructions that are just for 
            human readability and not read by the machine. Code is usually put into functions. For the first function, 
            the <b>void</b> means that the function is returning nothing which is what we want for a simple program. Then, the 
            name of the function comes next, in this case, it is <i>setup</i>. The <b>()</b> tells you the inputs of the function. 
            We have no inputs. Then, the body of the function is enclosed in curly braces, {}.
            Code the following into the terminal:
            <br>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
// there are two functions in Arduino: setup and loop
// setup runs only once
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600); // open the serial port at 9600 bps:
}

// loop runs over and over
void loop() {
    Serial.println("Hello World!");  // prints to the terminal and makes a new line
    delay(1000);    // sleeps the program for 1000 ms (1 second)
}
                </code>
            </pre>

                    <h4>Part (1): Breadboarding Basics and Multimeters (25 mins)  <a id="part1"> </a></h4>
                    <p> The goal of this section is to make a LED blink. However, we need to 
                        lay our circuit on something like a breadboard.
                        A breadboard is basically like a preliminary construction board for making circuits! The areas 
                        highlighted in green are the parts that are connected. The holes allow you to stick wires inside.
                    </p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/breadboard-diagram.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
                    <p>Typically, you put the ground line on the blue minus rail (-) and the power on the 
                        red plus rail (+). This way, you can easily grab those connections.</p>
                    <p>When you want to insert a resistor, you do not want to put both legs in the same row (same green region).
                         You want to put it in a different row (a different green line). This is because the first method shorts it. 
                         Current would simply never flow into it since it wants to go the path of least resistance. Below is a 
                         good example:
                    </p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/wiring-breadboard-ex.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
                    <p>We want to introduce you to some other tools, too. How do we get wire to connect components? We can use a 
                        <b>wire stripper</b> and get it from a spool of wire. In the image below, you can see the stripper. 
                        There are different-sized holes representing the gauge of the wire.
                    </p>
                    <img src=media/lab9/wire-strip.jpeg class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
                    <p>In the image above, using the hole makes an incision on only the insulation, and then you pull the insulation off to 
                        only expose the metal on a potion of the wire. To cut the wire, you clamp the wire on the section where it says 
                        cut on the strippers (the bottom portion of the sharp edge). You should get something like this:</p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/wire-stripped.jpeg class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">    
                    <p>To test connections, there is another tool for sensing: the <b>multimeter</b>. It has features like testing voltage, current, 
                        connection, etc. The orientations of the symbols change from multimeter to multimeter, but the symbols are what stay consistent. 
                        We will note the ones that matter for this lab and future labs here. 
                    </p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/multimeter.jpg class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
                    <p>
                        The <b>V</b> with a dotted and straight lines above it measures DC voltage. DC, or direct current, is basically 
                        signals not changing consistently or very often. The ohm symbol, <b>Œ©</b>, stands for measuring resistance. The 
                        WiFi looking signal with the curved lines in series is <b>continuity</b> mode. It beeps when there is an electrical connection 
                        between the positive and negative terminals of the multimeter. Try testing each of these modes and be prepared to show 
                        them off during checkoff.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, this is the schematic we will build:</p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/led-res-schem.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
                    <p>However, we will not tell you what resistor value to use. Using <b>V=IR</b>, we will ask you to figure out 
                    what resistory to use. Note that the Arduino supplies 3.3 V. For current, let's try to get between 10-15 mA.</p>

                    <h4>Part (2): Making a LED Blink (20 minutes)  <a id="part2"> </a></h4>
        
                <p>Now, you're ready to start making your full circuit on the breadboard. We will use pin 11 as our output pin 
                    (the positive terminal) instead of the 3.3 V. Also, the shorter leg of the LED should be connected to ground. 
                    Anode is the positive end of the LED (longer leg) while cathode is the other leg.
                    To make the LED blink, use this code: </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-javascript">
// there are two functions in Arduino: setup and loop
// setup runs only once
void setup() {
    pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
}

// loop runs over and over
void loop() {
  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(11, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  digitalWrite(11, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
}
                    </code>

            <h4>Part (3): Learning Soldering (15 mins) <a id="part3"></a></h4>
                    <p>Soldering is a technique to connect two electrical components together. 
                        Solder is usually a leaded metal that you melt down and acts as glue. The soldering
                        iron heats up the solder to turn it into a liquid that can flow. For our first step,
                        let's turn on the iron to 450 degrees Celsius. For this whole process, don't be afraid 
                        to ask for help from one of your instructors. Soldering can be daunting at first.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cut a long piece of wire (about 25 cm). Strip the wire to expose some of the metal.</p>
                    <img src=media/lab9/wire-strip.jpeg class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
                    <p>Now, bring the solder, soldering iron, the wire, and the leg of the button together.
                        You will see the solder melt and become a glue. It only becomes a glue that keeps 
                        components together when it cools and becomes solid. So when it is cooling, make 
                        sure that everything is stable and holds together. Using clips to hold things together 
                        helps with all of this. This is pictured below.
                    </p>

                    <p>Repeat this with two more legss on the button to have three legs soldered for a single button.</p>

                    <p>To understand how the button is wired internally, we have to use multimeter, specifically its 
                        continuity mode that we learned about in a previous lab. Draw a picture of what the internal 
                        wiring of the button looks like. What legs are the button are connected? Which leg will you 
                        connect to GND, 3.3 V, and the input pin?

        <h4>Part (5): Wiring the GND, 3.3 V, and Input Pins (25 mins)</h4> <a id="part5"> </a>
        <p>Now, solder all the GND wires together, the 3.3 V wires together, and input pins and plug them into the Arduino.
        Zip tie all the wires together and electrical tape them to have clean design. The electrical tape should cover all 
        the exposed metal. You should have something that looks like this: </p>

                    Open Processing and try running the game with just the arrow keys (left, down, right). If that works, then we can test the Serial.
                 Open Arduino and run the Serial code we ran prior. This will ensure that information is being written into the port that we can grab from 
                Processing. Now, run the Processing code once more. Your controller should work now! Don't hesitate to ask questions if you have any. 
                Take a bit of time to understand the Processing code. You will be asked some questions during the discussion portion of the lab, particularly, 
                about the Serial communication portion. </p>

        <p> Now it's time to ‚Äúremix‚Äù this assignment by adding your own flair! Be creative and 
            think about how you can personalize your design.
            If there's anything specific you want to create but aren't sure how, 
            let us know so we can guide you! Some suggestions are chaning the button designs on the GUI, adding another button, 
            changing scoring, etc.</p>
