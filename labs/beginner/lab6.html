                    <!-- Part 0: Hello World, Arduino! -->
                    <h4>Part (0): Hello World, Arduino! (15 min) <a id="part0"> </a></h4>

                    <p>Today, we will be working with Arduino, a microcontroller. A microcontroller is basically a very small computer 
                        chip that can interface with the real world using voltages. Arduino is just a user-friendly and widely used microcontroller.
                    </p>
        
        <p>Our first step is downloading the software, Arduino IDE. Arduino is the physical microcontroller 
            and the IDE is the code software. 
            Navigate to this <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">link</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Then, we need to physically plug in the Arduino Uno into the laptop like this: </p>
        <img src=media/lab6/arduino-laptop.webp class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
        <p>Now, we can try to open the Arduino IDE program. You should be greeted by a window that looks like this:</p>
        <img src=media/lab6/arduino-start.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
        <br>
        <p>Mine happened to automatically connect to the Arduino Uno. However, to double check that the device was configured, 
            navigate to Tools > Port > Arduino Uno and make sure that is the Arduino Uno. You should get something like this:
        </p>
        <img src=media/lab6/device-setup.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
        <br>
        <p>Let's also click Tools > Serial Monitor. A terminal at the bottom of your window will appear.
            
            <br> <br> <b> The Serial Monitor </b> 
            is a print window which you can output information. This a great tool to make sure your code is working correctly, 
            a term called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/debugging/#:~:text=Debugging%20is%20the%20process%20of,determine%20why%20any%20errors%20occurred."> <i>debugging</i></a>. We will come back to the terminal once we start running our code.
        </p>
        <p>Now, we will try to understand the basic structure of Arduino code which is in the C programming language.
            The program is divided into setup() and loop(). The code inside setup is ran once when the Arduino is first powered 
            while the code inside loop is ran repeatedly after the setup. Let's take a deeper look into a code block.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
// this is a comment
void setup() { // this is an in-line comment
    Serial.begin(9600); // this is code that opens the Serial port and 9600 bits per second
}</code>
        </pre>
                    <p>When you see parenthesis after some text, it is typically a <span style=color:red> function </span>. So,  <span style=color:red> <i>setup()</i> </span>, <span style=color:red> <i>loop()</i> </span>, and <span style=color:red> <i>begin()</i> </span> are 
            all functions. A function is a block of code. The parenthesis can be empty like <i>setup()</i> and <i>loop()</i> or have an input. 
            <i>begin(9600)</i> for instance has an input of 9600. 
            
            <br> <br> In the above code, we are defining what is inside setup(), hence the curly braces. 
            The void at the beginning means are returning nothing at the end of the function. Then, inside of the {} is the body of the code. 
            Each line of code in the body must end in a ;. Lines that begin with a <b>//</b> are comments which are instructions that are just for 
            human readability and not read by the machine. Type the above code into your window. Let's move to the loop function.
        </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
// there are two functions in Arduino: setup and loop
// setup runs only once
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600); // open the serial port at 9600 bps:
}

// loop runs over and over
void loop() {
    Serial.println("Hello World!");  // prints to the Serial Monitor and makes a new line
    delay(1000);    // sleeps the program for 1000 ms (1 second)
}
                </code>
            </pre>
<p>Now, type the above code into your code window. This will print "Hello World!" into your Serial Monitor every second. 
    Try clicking the run button (the circle with the arrow at the top of the window). You should see something printing now!
    Congrats on *maybe* your first Arduino program!

                    <!-- Part 1: Getting a Preliminary GUI -->
                    <h4>Part (1): Breadboarding Basics and Multimeters (25 mins)  <a id="part1"> </a></h4>
                    <p> The goal of this section is to make a LED blink. However, we need to 
                        lay our circuit on something like a breadboard.
                        A breadboard is basically like a preliminary construction board for making circuits! The areas 
                        highlighted in green are the parts that are electrically connected to each other. The holes allow you to stick wires inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>Normal Breadboard:</p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/breadboard-raw.jpg class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
                    <br>
                    <p>Internal Wiring of Breadboard:</p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/breadboard-diagram.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
                    <p>üí° Typically, you put the ground line on the blue minus rail (‚ûñ) and the power on the 
                        red plus rail (‚ûï). This way, you can easily grab those connections.</p>
                    
                    <p>We want to introduce you to some other tools, too. How do we get wire to connect components? We can use a 
                        <b>wire stripper</b> and get it from a spool of wire. In the image below, you can see the stripper. 
                        There are different-sized holes representing the gauge of the wire.
                    </p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/wire-gauge-edit.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
                    <br>
                    <p>In the image above, using the hole makes an incision on only the insulation, and then you pull the insulation off to 
                        only expose the metal on a portion of the wire. To cut the wire, you clamp the wire on the section where it says 
                        cut on the strippers (the bottom portion of the sharp edge). You should get something like this:</p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/wire-stripped-edit.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">    
                    
                    
                    <br> 
                    <p>To test connections, there is another tool for measuring: the <b>multimeter</b>. It has features like testing voltage, current, 
                        connection, etc. The orientations of the symbols change from multimeter to multimeter, but the symbols are what stay consistent. 
                        We will note the ones that matter for this lab and future labs here. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <br> <br> 
                    <img src=media/lab6/multimeter-edited.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
                    <p>
                        The <b>V</b> with a dotted and straight lines above it measures DC voltage. DC, or direct current, is basically 
                        signals not changing consistently or very often. The ohm symbol, <b>Œ©</b>, stands for measuring resistance. The 
                        WiFi looking signal with the curved lines in series is <b>continuity</b> mode. It beeps üîâ when there is an electrical connection 
                        between the positive and negative terminals of the multimeter. Try testing each of these modes and be prepared to show 
                        them off during checkoff.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>However, we will not tell you what resistor value to use. Using <b>V=IR</b>, we will ask you to figure out 
                    what resistor to use. Note that the Arduino supplies 3.3 V. For current, let's try to get between 10-15 mA.</p>

                    <h4>Part (2): Making a LED Blink on Your Breadboard (20 minutes)  <a id="part2"> </a></h4>
                    <p> ‚ö†Ô∏è Again, whenever wiring on your breadboard, please <b>disconnect</b> the Arduino wire 
                        from the computer so that the power is <b>OFF</b>. Let's go over the compoents and how to to insert components. </p>
                    <p>Since we have limited wire strippers and limited time, let's just use jumper wires. These are just pre-cut 
                        wires that you can insert immediately into the breadboard.
                    </p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/jumper-gif.gif class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">   
                    <br>
                    <p>Refer to the breadboard image in Part (1) to understand the green lines we're talking about. 
                        When you want to insert a resistor, you do not want to put both legs in the same row (same green region).
                        You want to put it in a different row (a different green line). This is because the first method shorts it. 
                        Current would simply never flow into it since it wants to go the path of least resistance. 
                        The image below is a valid way of inserting a resistor. The resistor's legs are in two different rows.
                        This is a diagram of what you will build:

                   <p>An LED has two diffent legs. The shorter leg of the LED should be connected to ground. 
                    Anode is the positive end of the LED (longer leg) while cathode is the other leg.</p>

                    (the positive terminal).</p>
                <p>After you have built the circuit physically, it is time to code again. We will be introducing two new functions: 
                    <i>pinMode()</i> and <i>digitaWrite()</i>. <i>pinMode()</i> sets a pin of the Arduino to some mode. We make it 
                    OUPUT mode so that we can "write" to it and set it to voltages. To write to a pin, we use the digitalWrite() to 
                    assign a voltage to a pin.
                    To make the LED blink, replace the code in the code editor with this code: </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-javascript">
// there are two functions in Arduino: setup and loop
// setup runs only once
void setup() {
    pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // this makes pin 11 an output
}

// loop runs over and over
void loop() {
  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(11, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  digitalWrite(11, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>You should have a üí°blinking LEDüí° now!</p>

            <h4>Part (3): Wiring RFID (20 mins) <a id="part3"></a></h4>
                    <p>As mentioned in lecture, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a universal security system. 
                        There are three main components of RFID: the PICC (your card), the PCD (the reader), and the 
                        computer (the Arduino). RFID is very difficult to make from scratch. So, we will use some help. 
                        The RC522 chip module does a lot of the processing for us and will act us a reader.</p>

                    <p>üöß Deconstruct the LED circuit before wiring the RFID chip.
                        Now, we need to wire the RFID chip to the Arduino. This will require quite a few wires. Try
                        to plan your wiring to be as neat as possible. Use the jumper wires to make the connections. 
                        Here is a diagram and table of the connections.

                    <p>We need to connect the RC522 to our Arduino to communicate to it. 
                        We slot it into our breadboard like this such that the reader is facing out:

                    <br>
                    <p>So, finish your wiring. Once you are confident enough in your wiring, it is time to test it using code. We will use a 
                        <i>library</i> to help us. A library is code that someone else has written that we borrow functions from. 
                        We will install the MFRC522 library. On the left sidebar, there is an icon of books stacked. 
                        Click it to open the library manager. Type "mfrc522" and install the library <b>MFRC522 by Github Community</b>.
                    </p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/library.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
                   
                    <p>Now, the library has been installed. Let's open an example. Go to File > Examples > MFRC522 > DumpInfo.</p>

                    <p>This will open a DumpInfo file. Example files are pre-written files of code that are ready to be ran. There are 
                        many examples you can explore at a later time. Now, we will need to make one small change to our DumpInfo file to 
                        make it work for us.

                    It's a bit messy but at least we can read information. There's a lot of information other than just the 
                    UID that we can extract from the card in the Serial Monitor but we just wanted to confirm that it 
                    works.

                    <h4>Part (4): Making an Access System for your ID (20 mins)</h4><a id="part4"> </a>
                    <p>We can extract information from the cards, but we don't do anything with the UID yet. We'll 
                        make a simple Access System. A green LED will flash when the correct card is read while a red 
                        LED will flash when a wrong card is read. Let's construct our circuit first. We only need to make a 
                        small addition. The same way that we did the LED circuit in a previous part, wire one circuit for a green LED 
                        and one for a red LED. The green LED should use Pin 2, and the red LED should use Pin 3. The picture is a little wrong.
                    </p>
                    <img src=media/lab6/rfid-all-schem.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
                    <br>
                    <p>The schematic above shows the whole circuit you should have. The Green LED is connected to Pin 0 while the 
                        Red LED is connected to Pin 1. The RFID circuit itself stays the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you feel confident that your circuit is correct, it's time to test it with some code. 
                        We will go step-by-step with this code and keep appending to the same file.
                        Make a new file in Arduino (File > New Sketch).

                    <p>First, we import our libraries to write less code from scratch ourselves.</p>
