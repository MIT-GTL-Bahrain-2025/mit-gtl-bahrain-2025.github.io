                    <p> In the game Guitar Hero, the user interacts with a screen with colored markers.
                        Whenever the colored markers reach the bottom line, the player must press the associated
                        buttons in time with the music. This screen that the user witnesses is known as a 
                        GUI, graphical user interface.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soldering Iron Temperature:</strong> Ensure that the soldering iron is never left unattended. It reaches temperatures of 
            ~500 degrees Celsius so never make it touch anything it is not supposed to.</li>
            <li><strong>Lead Poisoning:</strong> Most solder contains lead. This is very toxic if ingested. Always wash your hands immediately after soldering and never
             touch your face.</li>

        <h5>Designing Your CapSense Guitar (If you did not finish last lab):</h5>
        <p>In the last lab, if you had some time, you already finished adding capacitive sensing on your guitar. If not, no worries!
            You can finish this now.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some CapSense ideas:</p>
        <img src=media/CapTouch/guitar-remix.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
        <br>
        <p>All you need to do is add 3 "buttons". This could be adding 3 pieces of copper tape or something. And make sure you add 
            wires coming out of the copper accessory you put on the guitar so that we can solder it later.  This is similar to how the 
            copper module you built in the last lab had wires coming out. You do NOT need to solder it to the 
            CapSense shield right now. Like see how the wires come out of the module here from the last lab:

                    <!-- Part 1: Getting a Preliminary GUI -->
                    <h4>Part (1): Getting a Preliminary GUI (10 mins)  <a id="part1"> </a></h4>
                    <p> Processing uses a programming language called Java. Just like Arduino, it has two main functions: 
                        setup() and draw(). setup() is similar to the setup() in Arduino. It runs once at the beginning. draw() 
                        is synonymous with loop() from Arduino where the function runs over and over. draw(), in fact, runs 60 
                        times a second. This means that you can make simple animations!
                    </p>
                    <p> To make a basic window, we will introduce you to a library, <b>controlP5</b>. A library is basically someone else's code and 
                        you borrow the functions that they have written and simply call them. Most libraries have their documentation 
                    online. Learning to look up documentation is an important skill for any programmer. The controlP5 library can be found 
                    <a href="https://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/"> here.</a></p>


                        <p>To use the library, you have to import it 
                        before you start using it. We won't go deeply into it, but there are objects in programming that contain certain 
                        properties. In the following code, we make a ControlP5 object called <i>cp5</i>. This oject has properties and functions like adding 
                        buttons. And to run the code, press the play button on the top left.
                        Let‚Äôs test some preliminary code, type this, and run:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-javascript">
import controlP5.*; // import ControlP5 library

ControlP5 cp5; // create ControlP5 object

void setup(){
    size(300, 400); //window size, (width, height) in pixels
}

void draw(){
    background(50, 70, 100); //background color of window (r, g, b) from 0-255
    //let's give title to our window
    // we have a pen we draw with and we select its color with the fill function
    fill(0, 0, 0); // text color (r, g, b)
    text("GUITAR HERO", 100, 30); // ("text", x coord, y coord) in pixels
}
                        </code>
                        </pre>

                        <p>You should get a dark blue window with Guitar Hero.</p>
                        <img src=media/lab9/first-code.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
                    <br> 
                    <p>Now, let's add a Button and font. So your code should look like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-javascript">
import controlP5.*; // import ControlP5 library
PFont font; 

ControlP5 cp5; // create ControlP5 object

void setup(){
    size(300, 400); //window size, (width, height) in pixels
    
    font = createFont("ComicSansMS", 20); //select the font

    cp5 = new ControlP5(this); // Initialize the ControlP5 object

    cp5.addButton("START")  // START is button name
        .setPosition(100, 50)  // x and y coords of upper left corner
        .setSize(100, 80)     //(width, height) in pixels
        .setFont(font)
        ;
}

void draw(){
    background(50, 70, 100); //background color of window (r, g, b) from 0-255
    //let's give title to our window
    fill(0, 0, 0); // text color (r, g, b)
    text("GUITAR HERO", 100, 30); // ("text", x coord, y coord) in pixels
}
                        </code>
                        </pre>
                        <p>Rerun and you should see a button.</p>
                        <img src=media/lab9/btn-font.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
                        <br>
                        <p>Now since Processing runs the draw function 60 times per second, we can make animations! 
                            We'll add some circle code that updates the position every time it runs. Copy paste this code and 
                            your IDE should look something like this:

}

void draw(){

    //Circle code animation
    // draw current frame based on state
    ellipse(100, circleY, 50, 50);
  
    // modify state
    circleY = circleY + 1;
  
    // reset state
    if(circleY > height) {
      circleY = 0;
    }
    
    //let's give title to our window

        <h4>Part (2): Adding a Button (15 mins) </h4><a id="part2"> </a>
        <p>We want our guitar to have buttons. Buttons can read as 3.3 V or 0 V.
            To understand how the button is wired internally, we have to use multimeter, specifically its 
            continuity mode that we learned about in a previous lab. When the multimeter beeps, you know the two legs 
            of the button are connected. Traditionally, we think of a button with two legs: unconnected when unpressed and 
            connected when pressed. However, the buttons we gave has four legs.
        </p>
        <img src=media/lab9/fourbutton.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
        <p>To understand the orientation you need to place the button in, please use a multimeter. Then, you can place a single 
            button on a breadboard like this for example:

                    <h4>Part (3): Adding Serial Communication in Processing (20 minutes)  <a id="part3"> </a></h4>
        <p> Now, let‚Äôs try learning how to add Serial communication.  
        </p>
        <p><b>Note: You must close your Serial Monitor in Arduino before running the Processing file, or else you will get the error that the 
            port is busy.
        </b></p>
        <p>Here is how the Serial works basically:</p>
        <img src=media/lab9/arduino-serial.png class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
        <br>
        <p>Replace your program with this code below in Processing in a new file. Look particularly and lines 8 and 9. If the buttons do not print to the Processing terminal, 
            then we are likely using the wrong port. Change the port number to work with your computer. Feel free to ask for help if you have 
            tried multiple port numbers and they have not worked.</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
import processing.serial.*;

Serial myPort;  // Create object from Serial class
String val;     // Data received from the serial port

void setup(){
    size(300, 400); //window size, (width, height)
    println(Serial.list()); //print all the ports you have and choose the one that is the Arduino
    String portName = Serial.list()[2]; //change the 2 to a 0 or 1 or 3 etc. to match your port
    myPort = new Serial(this, portName, 9600);
}

void draw(){
    background(50, 70, 100); //background color of window (r, g, b) from 0-255
    //let's give title to our window
    fill(0, 0, 0); // text color (r, g, b)
    text("GUITAR HERO", 100, 30); // ("text", x coord, y coord)
    if ( myPort.available() > 0) 
    {  // If data is available,
    val = myPort.readStringUntil('\n');         // read it and store it in val
    } 
    println(val); //print it out in the console
}
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p>This is communication from Arduino to computer. You can also do communication from Processing to Arduino! 
                It would be the same process of opening the port and doing <code>myPort.write("something")</code>.
            </p>

            <p>Go to this url and download the folder. <a href="https://github.com/fzaman500/mit-gtl-bahrain-2025-guitar-hero">Guitar Hero Link.</a> 
                To download the zip folder, click the green code button, and finally click download zip.
                Open the Processing file named <i>rhythmgame.pde</i>. It is under <i>Processing/rhythmgame</i> folder.</p>
                <p>Since our game has sound, we need to install the Sound library. Download the <i>Sound</i> library with The Processing Foundation as the author. You do this 
                the same way we did for the Serial and ControlP5 library.</p>
                <p><b>Reminder: You must make sure the Arduino Serial Monitor is closed before running the Processing file.</b></p>
                <p>Navigate to line 68 in the code. Change the location of the trackdata file with the location on your laptop.</p>
                <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">

            </pre>
               <p> Now, try running the game with just the arrow keys (left, down, right). If that works, then we can test the Serial.
             Make sure your Arduino is plugged in and make sure your Serial monitor is closed. This will ensure that information is being written into the port that we can grab from 
            Processing. Now, run the Processing code once more. Your breadboard controller should work now! Don't hesitate to ask questions if you have any. 
            Take a bit of time to understand the Processing code. You will be asked some questions during checkoff of the lab, particularly, 
            about the Serial communication portion. The most notable lines are lines 50-54 and 276-284.</p>

            <h4>Part (5): Learning Heatshrinking and Soldering Onto Guitar and Shield (15 mins) <a id="part5"></a></h4>
                    <p>Soldering is a technique to connect two electrical components together. 
                        Solder is usually a leaded metal that you melt down and acts as glue. The soldering
                        iron heats up the solder to turn it into a liquid that can flow. For our first step,
                        let's turn on the iron to 450 degrees Celsius. For this whole process, don't be afraid 
                        to ask for help from one of your instructors. Soldering can be daunting at first.
                    </p>
                    <p>This YouTube video shows how to solder on a circuit board and how to solder on wires. This is optional to watch if you already familiar.</p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="310" class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qps9woUGkvI?si=WBCRzVkY6fdMaffp" title="YouTube video player"  allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>At the solder station, you will solder the wires to a capsense module such that it is long enough to reach the Arduino location on the guitar.
                        The button closest to the Arduino should be soldered onto <b>0</b> on the CapSense shield, the middle one should 
                        be soldered onto <b>1</b> on the CapSense shield, and the farthest button should be soldered onto <b>2</b> on the CapSense shield.
                    </p>
                    <p>There's also another technique for putting electrical components together cleanly. So, we used soldering to connect wires together. However, they're 
                        just hanging out and can accidentally touch other exposed wires which would make connections that we don't want and, in the worst case, can cause a fire.
                        So, we can insulate the wire by wrapping it in electrical tape or <i>heatshrink</i>. Heatshrink is a plastic tubing that shrinks when heat is applied. 
                        We use a heatgun (which spews hot air) to wrap it around the exposed wire. In the gif below, I put the heatshrink over the exposed wire.
                    </p>
                    <img src=media/lab9/heatshrink.gif class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid"> 
                    <br>
                    <p><b>After looking at this quick tutorial, go to the solder station and have an instructor help you solder and heatshrink.</b></p>

                        <h4>Checkoff 5</h4> 
                    Your guitar should be soldered and heatshrinked fully now!

        <h4>Part (6): Test the Guitar Hero Game Finally (10 mins)</h4> <a id="part6"> </a>
        <p>So, your guitar is now fully soldered. However since we are not using buttons, we want to adjust the Arduino code 
            to use CapSense. So, we want it to print "A", "B", and "C" whenever we press the appropriate places. We can just make some 
            edits to the CapSense code from last time. I have already made all the edits for you, so it should just work! Try uploading 
            the following Arduino code. Remember to close the Arduino Serial Monitor before running the Processing file.
